Thank you scaledrone for writing this nice tutorial

## Build the app
The source code is using AndroidX framework. Minimum SDK version is 19 (KitKat), so it will not work on older phones. But that should not be a problem, as BLE is only supported on newer phones.    
The code was made using Android Studio Version 3.5.3
